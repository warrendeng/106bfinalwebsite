## Project Overview
In this project we try to accomplish two goals. First, we survey texts relating to Control Lypanouv Functions and Control Barrier Functions in order to summarize this newly developed field. Second, we try to implement a CLF-CBF-QP Controller onto the Robatarium testbed using Control Barrier Functions for adaptive speed regulation and lane keeping. 

## Implementation
The implementation of the CLF-CBF-QP controller was done in MATLAB.
