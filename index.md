# EECS 206b Final Project

## Project Overview
In this project we try to accomplish two goals. First, we survey texts relating to Control Lypanouv Functions and Control Barrier Functions in order to summarize this newly developed field. Second, we try to implement a few different controllers onto the Robatarium testbed for adaptive speed regulation and lane keeping. We ran two main simulations. The first uses Barrier Functions and the second uses the CLF-CBF-QP controller. 

## Implementation
The implementation of the CLF-CBF-QP controller was written in MATLAB, tested on the simulator, and then tested on the actual testbed. It uses
